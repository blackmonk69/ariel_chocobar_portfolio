# About me
"I'm a data, IT, and SCM enthusiast. Although my professional career hasn't been exclusively related to Data Analysis, but rather to SCM, I've had the opportunity and the fortune to apply and hone my knowledge in Data Analysis. I've worked with SAP (MM), downloading transactions and statistics, cleaning them, sorting them, and linking them to a Power BI dashboard. I can also use various RDBMSs such as SQL Server and PostgreSQL as data sources. My Python programming skills allow me to leverage Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas to manipulate large amounts of data."
