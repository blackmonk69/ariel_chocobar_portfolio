# About me
"I'm a data, IT, and SCM enthusiast. Although my professional career hasn't been exclusively related to Data Analysis, but rather to SCM, I've had the opportunity and the fortune to apply and hone my knowledge in Data Analysis. I've worked with SAP (MM), downloading transactions and statistics, cleaning them, sorting them, and linking them to a Power BI dashboard. I can also use various RDBMSs such as SQL Server and PostgreSQL as data sources. My Python programming skills allow me to leverage Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas to manipulate large amounts of data."

* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask

# [Project 2: Pipeline built that transforms data from Kobo forms and produces a PowerBi Dashboard](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.

# [Project 3: Insight from CSV file using Jupyter Notes](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier) 
In this project we build and play around with stats from csv file on Jupyter Notebook, it shows the basic procedure, loading the data, transforming and cleaning and finally showing some graphs .
