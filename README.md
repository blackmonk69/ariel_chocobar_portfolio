# About me
"I'm a data, IT, and SCM enthusiast. Although my professional career hasn't been exclusively related to Data Analysis, but rather to SCM, I've had the opportunity and the fortune to apply and hone my knowledge in Data Analysis. I've worked with SAP (MM), handling and using transactions and data, cleaning them, sorting them, and linking them to a Power BI dashboard. I can also use various RDBMSs such as SQL Server and PostgreSQL as data sources. My Python programming skills allow me to leverage Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas to manipulate large amounts of data."

Note: Most of these projects are a replica of projects that I found on the internet, they are NOT copies, I replicated them on my computer and now I would like to share with you the results. Thanks


## [1 FIFA 21 - DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION ](https://github.com/blackmonk69/PORTFOLIO-GITHUB-DATA-ANALYTICS/tree/main/FIFA_21) 
Dataset with statistics from FIFA 21, where we perform basic operations on the data.

## [2 StackOverflow Survey ](https://github.com/blackmonk69/PORTFOLIO-GITHUB-DATA-ANALYTICS/tree/main/Stackoverflow_Survey) 
StackOverflow carries out an annual survey on developers, we propose to find out more about them in this project.

## [3 Bike Sharing Dataset](https://github.com/blackmonk69/PORTFOLIO-GITHUB-DATA-ANALYTICS/tree/main/Bike_Sharing) 
Bike Sharing statistics in the UK. A fine and nice EDA which will be helpful tu understand more about the idiosincracy of bikers in the United Kingdom
## [4 PowerBI and Canva](https://github.com/blackmonk69/PORTFOLIO-GITHUB-DATA-ANALYTICS/tree/main/POWER_BI_CANVA) 
## [5 Checkout my Project with Big Query and Looker Studio](https://github.com/blackmonk69/employee-analysis-and-big-query)   
In this project we perform an analysis of employee satisfaction and rating, the repository for the data is Big Query and the dashboard was built in Looker Studio. It is taken from a tutorial in you tube, however a few changes were added mainly in the creation of the tables and the design of the dashboard (e.g. added a section for conclusions).
## [6 Checkout my Projects with PowerBI at NovyPro](https://www.novypro.com/profile_about/arielchocobar)   
## [7 Project Cinemar - Cinema Management system built with Python and SQL lite 3 Data base following Model-View Controller philosophy](https://github.com/blackmonk69/proyecto-cinemar)    
## [8 Beautiful hand-crafted dashboard in Power BI using PostreSQL DB](https://github.com/blackmonk69/PostgreSQL_PowerBi_sales)
## [9 Datawarehouse built using MSSQL Server, Python, SQL and PowerBI](https://github.com/blackmonk69/SQL_DATAWAREHOUSE)
In this project we build a datawarehouse with the help of some csv files, MSSQL Server, Python. The whole idea is to show an ETL process where the data architecture is organized in layers (bronze, silver and gold) known as Medallion Architecture.
## [10 ML Project - A simple Car Prediction app using python librares and Streamlit](https://github.com/blackmonk69/ML_cars)
## [11 Simple FastApi example to show the simplicity of using SQLModel](https://github.com/blackmonk69/API_DBTASKS) 
This is a purely pedagogical example, it does not contain routers, MVC concepts, secrets in env files, error handling, etc. Just a few lines of basic code snippets showing the power of this ORM. This API handles a DB hosted in Neon website, the engine creates the tables if not existant, 2 endpoints: read tasks and create a task. 
## [12 A more advanced FastApi project using Alembic to handle DB migrations) 
This is a purely pedagogical example, it does not contain routers, MVC concepts, secrets in env files, error handling, etc. Just a few lines of basic code snippets showing the power of this ORM. This API handles a DB hosted in Neon website, the engine creates the tables if not existant, 2 endpoints: read tasks and create a task.
