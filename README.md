# About me
"I'm a data, IT, and SCM enthusiast. Although my professional career hasn't been exclusively related to Data Analysis, but rather to SCM, I've had the opportunity and the fortune to apply and hone my knowledge in Data Analysis. I've worked with SAP (MM), handling and using transactions and data, cleaning them, sorting them, and linking them to a Power BI dashboard. I can also use various RDBMSs such as SQL Server and PostgreSQL as data sources. My Python programming skills allow me to leverage Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas to manipulate large amounts of data."

Note: Most of these projects are a replica of projects that I found on the internet, they are NOT copies, I replicated them on my computer and now I would like to share with you the results. Thanks

## [5 Checkout my Project with Big Query and Looker Studio](https://github.com/blackmonk69/employee-analysis-and-big-query)

In this project we perform an analysis of employee satisfaction and rating, the repository for the data is Big Query and the dashboard was built in Looker Studio. It is taken from a tutorial in you tube, however a few changes were added mainly in the creation of the tables and the design of the dashboard (e.g. added a section for conclusions).
